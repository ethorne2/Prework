Submitted by: Elizabeth Thorne

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if &lt;10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

I considered creating a settings screen and I was unable to find out how to connect the items placed on the settings story board to code. Since this was an optional feature, I decided to stick with the requirements. I am new to iOS programming, and really excel with being in a course with help from instructors and peers. I look forward to all that I will learn in this course!
